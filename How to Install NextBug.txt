How to Install NextBug

- Install Bugzilla (go to http://www.bugzilla.org and follow the instructions) if you dont already have it =)

- Unpack the contents of the Nextbug file in the "extensions/" folder inside Bugzilla (a NextBug folder will be created).

- In NextBug folder there is a "required_libs" subfolder with Perl libraries. Install the libraries to your Perl interpreter (follow the instructions for each library). NextBug-1.0 requires four libraries: Lingua-Stem-Snowball, Lingua-StopWords, Log4perl, and Math-Random-ISAAC.

- Set the NextBug folder (and all its subfolders) permissions to be the same as Bugzilla. For example, to change the permissions: "chmod -R 751 NextBug/", also change the owner: "chown -R <bugzilla-owner> NextBug/", and the group: "chgrp -R <bugzilla-owner> NextBug/".

- Remove the "disabled" file inside the NextBug folder.

- Enjoy the features of NextBug.
